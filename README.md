# Three Across 

This is a simple game of tic tac toe, designed with two players in mind. 
The players take turns placing their symbols on the game board. 


## Features 

The board contains nine squares. Clicking on any of the cells put an "X" on the first turn. 
The second click mars a square with an "O". 
The first one to get three of either "X" or "O" wins. 
If no one gets three in a row it results in a draw!

After a game is finished the winning screen appears for the first player. 
The results are either a win, a loss or a draw. 
The player then gets the option of restarting the game.

## Features that could be implemented
* An introduction screen for the game with more options
* The option of having a computer driven second player 
* A score counter that counts wins/draws/losses
* Adding sound when placing symbols on the board

## Testing 

The game works but cramps up a little bit on the lowest of resolutions but works fine on most screens. 
Had some problems making the squares stick together as they where pulled apart in rows of three equally divided on the screen height.
